# Hello!

This is just a little test with a procedurally animated 4-legged spider.  
I'm not sure where I'm gonna go with this demo, but I'll figure that out when I get there.

## ToDo:
- Improve camera damping / camera settings
- good lighting/shaders
- unity particle system? add some hanging bits to help with orientation
- Jumping / ragdolls (maybe?)
- give spider webs
- fix ability to phase through walls somehow
