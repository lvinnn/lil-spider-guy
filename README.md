# Hello!

This is just a little test with a procedurally animated 4-legged spider.  
I'm not sure where I'm gonna go with this demo, but I'll figure that out when I get there.

## ToDo:
- Make spider able to walk on wires / improve ground and wall detection
- Rotate spider down when walking over a cliff
- Add camera damping / fix camera settings
- Make gravity
- Jumping / ragdolls (maybe?)
