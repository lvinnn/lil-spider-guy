Hello! this is just a lil test with a procedurally animated 4 legged spider.
I'm not sure where I'm gonna go with this demo, but I'll figure that out when I get there.

ToDo:
make spider able to walk on wires/improve ground wall detection
rotate spider down when walking over a cliff.
add camera damping/fix camera settings
make gravity
jumping/ragdolls (maybe?)
