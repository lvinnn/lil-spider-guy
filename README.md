# Hello!

This is just a little test with a procedurally animated 4-legged spider.  
I'm not sure where I'm gonna go with this demo, but I'll figure that out when I get there.

## ToDo:
- Improve camera damping / camera settings
- Fix bug where spider starts levetating if inside an object
- Fix bug where spider falls when legs are not anchored
- Make gravity
- Jumping / ragdolls (maybe?)
- give spider webs
- unity particle system?
- could make this a roguelike? add enemies+pathfinding,items/weapons,powerups, interactable parts of the map
