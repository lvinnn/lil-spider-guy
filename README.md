# Hello!

This is just a little test with a procedurally animated 4-legged spider.  
I'm not sure where I'm gonna go with this demo, but I'll figure that out when I get there.

## ToDo:
- Improve camera damping / camera settings
- the map with smoothed normals has like a million verts, fix that
- fix shader to deal with multiple lights
- add some enemies?
- comic style hits/ bang pow type shit
- interactables - elevator, portals, buttons etc
- some sort of UI perhaps
